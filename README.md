Futoshiki Puzzle: Logic Modeling, SAT-Solver Integration, and Heuristic Strategies | Project Using Python

I formulated game rules into logical expressions compatible with SAT-solving for the Futoshiki puzzle project. 
The software interface I built converts problem instances into DIMACS files. Developing a program to interpret 
SAT-solver traces and display puzzle solutions honed my programming and problem-solving skills.
